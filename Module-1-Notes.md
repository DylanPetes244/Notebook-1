# Module 1 

```diff
+ Here are my notes to myself on the first module
```
## Day 1
I have finally decided what I am going to pick. I would like to pick something from the new Canadian History Hall

## Day 2
I intend to pick an object that displays the three voices of Canadian history. I would like to pick something that has multiple histories. A way to show Indigenous voices, French-Canadian voices and British voices. So often we hear the British history and not necesarrily the "forgotten" voices. I would like to reframe and redisplay this history
